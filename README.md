# Chunk Mate

This is a tool to explore visualy different text splitting ("chunking") strategies work. 

Heavily inspired by [Greg Kamradt](https://x.com/GregKamradt)'s [Five levels of text Splitting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8OJC21T2SL4) and accompanying online tool [ChunkViz](https://chunkviz.up.railway.app/).

ChunkMate is built using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), a Python library for building web applications.
